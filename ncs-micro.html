        <h1 class="center">The 7 Dwarfs of Customer Service!</h1>
        <p class="into">
            At a summer camp, customer service isn't just a business practice, it's a vital part of the experience. Whether we're helping a leader with a question, welcoming a new camper, or guiding a troop through check-in, every interaction shapes how people feel about camp. Good customer service builds trust, reinforces our values, and creates the kind of positive memories that keep Scouts and leaders coming back year after year. Just like the seven dwarfs had their own unique traits, each staff member brings something special to the table. When we work together with a helpful attitude, camp becomes a place where everyone feels welcome, safe, and supported.
