COPE stands for Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience. It is comprised of a series of outdoor challenges, beginning with basic group initiative games, and progresses to more complicated low-course and high-course activities. Some of these elements involve teamwork, while others test individual skills and agility. Participants climb, swing, balance, jump, rappel, and think through solutions to a variety of challenges.

Throughout the year, the Cradle of Liberty Council COPE/Climbing Committee offers this program in a variety of forms for Scouts ages 13 and up. To sign-up for a pre-scheduled weekend, or to schedule your own weekend, reach out to COPE/Climbing Chairman [Dave Gibbons](/contact?subject=COPE).
