      Here are a few of the ways we have been prepared for girls, and how we continue to work towards the future:
      <ul>
        <li>
           Over 1,000 female Scouts BSA campers have made lasting memories since 2019! Resica Falls also has a history of serving Female British Scouts and Japanese Venturers, as well as local Sea Scout Ships and Venturing Crews.
        </li>
        <li>
          The camp leadership has developed a well-rounded, action-packed program designed to meet a variety of individual needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resica has hired an increasing number of female staff, in both junior staff and camp leadership positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camp improvements that have been made in recent years are female friendly, particularly our two showerhouse exmpansions. An additional 17 new individual showers / bathrooms have been added to accommodate the needs of all our campers.
        </li>
      </ul>

They can also join our provisional program ‘Resica Troop 1’ for their summer camp stay. The camp will provide qualified two-deep leadership with one being female.</p>
