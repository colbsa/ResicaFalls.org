      Here are a few of the ways we have been prepared for girls, and how we continue to work towards the future:
      <ul>
        <li>
           Over 200 female Scouts BSA campers made lasting memories in 2021! Resica Falls also has a history of serving Female British Scouts and Japanese Venturers, as well as local Sea Scout Ships and Venturing Crews.
        </li>
        <li>
          The camp leadership has developed a well-rounded, action-packed program designed to meet a variety of individual needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resica has hired an increasing number of female staff, in both junior staff and camp leadership positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camp improvements that have been made in recent years are female friendly, particularly the 2015 Great Bend Showerhouse &ndash; an entire facility comprised of 10 individual showers/bathrooms. <strong>NEW in 2021!</strong> &mdash; An additional 7 new individual showers / bathrooms located at the Big Springs Pool to accommodate the needs of all our campers.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h5>Don't Miss Out!</h5>
        <p>All new units will receive the early bird rate of $475 pricing for the 2022 season.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title text-center">With A Unit</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Your Scout Unit goes through the regular process of registering to attend summer camp at Resica. You will need to meet the two-deep adult leadership requirement, with at least one of those leaders being female. 
          <br><br>
        If your Scout Unit is unable to secure two adult leaders for their stay in camp, we’ll work to pair you with another Scout Unit already attending Resica. Again, one of the leaders of the combined group would need to be female.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title text-center">Troop One Provisional</h5>
        <p class="card-text">If you can’t come to summer camp as a Scout Unit, there is still the opportunity for individual girls to attend Resica. They can also join our provisional program ‘Resica Troop 1’ for their summer camp stay. The camp will provide qualified two-deep leadership with one being female.</p>
