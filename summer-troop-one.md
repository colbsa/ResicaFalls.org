Our Resica Troop One program is designed to allow every Scout the opportunity to experience the adventure that awaits at Resica Falls. Members of our staff serve as Scoutmaster and as assistants for Troop One, providing those Scouts coming to camp without their unit, or those who want to experience a second week of camp, with the leadership and supervision needed for a fun stay in camp. Boys and girls participating in Resica One have the same experiences and opportunities as Scouts who camp with their regular troops.

The members of Troop One function as a normal troop throughout the week. The Scouts have the chance to earn merit badges and participate in camp-wide programs, eat meals in the dining hall, and sit around the campfire, all with this temporary troop. Please visit our [Dates and Rates](/summer/register) page for more information about pricing.
