Why work at a fast food or retail establishment that focuses on sales when you can have opportunities like these:

- Make lots of new friends in your area and from other states
- Spend a summer in the great outdoors where nature prevails
- Acquire experiential education (learning by doing) and new skills that will last a lifetime
- Learn how to lead others and to apply leadership skills
- Be part of an effective team and cooperate with others to get things done

Working on a campstaff is a fun way to spend your summer, and it gives you the opportunity to make a difference in the life of each and every Scout that comes to camp. While being a counselor can be a demanding job, the rewards are endless as you forge memories that will last a lifetime.

    <p>"I worked on staff for five Summers. When I went to college, it felt like I was living in a dorm full of babies. Most of them had never lived away from Mom, washed their own clothes or had a real job. Working on staff put me far ahead of the rest of the students."</p>
    <p>"30 years later and my best friends are still the guys I was on camp staff with."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>"I’ve been in Scouting for a long time and have a lot of great memories. When I get together with my friends, the stories we tell and the friendships we talk about seem to revolve around our time on camp staff."</p>
    <p>"My time on staff helped me decide to become a school teacher."</p>
    <p>"I met my wife working on camp staff."</p>
