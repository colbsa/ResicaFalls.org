At its September meeting, the Cradle of Liberty Council Camping & Properties Committee, in consultation with the camp and council leadership teams, unanimously elected to consolidate the council's Scouts BSA summer camp operation into six week-long sessions. While this is a change in operation from recent years, Resica’s commitment to providing a superior summer camp experience to every Scout, leader, and unit will remain unchanged.

**Why the Change?**

A variety of factors led the Camping Committee to make its decision to consolidate the summer operation of camp into six weeks.
- Firstly, changing school schedules for both our high school and college aged staff members, along with our staff members who work in the education field, makes the operation of camp over seven weeks increasingly challenging, particularly in regards to camp set-up and breakdown.

- Secondly, concentrating camp program operations into six weeks will help provide more consistent attendance across the entire summer, alleviating the stress and crowdedness of weeks that are overfull or not full enough.

- Finally, the energy of our staff will remain high and their attention to details fresh as they work through a shorter summer camp season.

**What Does This Mean for My Unit?**

For the majority of our campers, this change will have no real impact on your experience at Resica Falls. An exceptional program will continue to be offered, a top-tier staff will still put on this exceptional program, and the food and facilities will continue to be improved - based upon your feedback - to meet your needs. Those units that traditionally joined us during Week 7 will have the opportunity to explore camp a little earlier in the summer than in the past.

We’ll still be offering three weeks of our [Troop One Provisional Program](/summer/provo) (Weeks 4, 5, and 6) and we’ll be continuing our [Webelos Week](/summer/webelos) started in 2022 (Week 6). [Paddlerama High Adventure Trips](/summer/paddlerama) down the Delaware River will still be available all six weeks of the summer, and we’re currently exploring other high adventure opportunities for the summer as well, including a Trail Crew program similar to the OA Trail Crew at Philmont. Our [SEEK Program](/summer/seek) will have one session (Weeks 1-3), training older campers in leadership and personal development, with the possibility of serving on camp staff in the future.
