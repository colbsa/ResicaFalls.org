Resica Falls is now accepting applications for Summer Camp Staff, and we're looking for energetic, caring, and adventurous people who want to make a real impact. Whether you love the outdoors, enjoy working with kids, or are looking to build leadership and teamwork skills, serving on camp staff is an unforgettable experience.

As a member of the Resica Falls team, you'll help create the moments campers remember forever -   first campfires, new friendships, conquered challenges, and big personal wins. Along the way, you'll gain hands-on experience, develop confidence, and join a passionate community of scouters.

We're hiring for a variety of roles, from program areas and outdoor skills to leadership and support positions. No matter your background, if you bring a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, there's a place for you here.

If you're ready for a summer filled with purpose, growth, and a whole lot of fun, applications are open now.
