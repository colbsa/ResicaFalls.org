### Travel back in time for the Wonder and Mystery

Resica Falls is back and better than ever! After a summer of Virtual Camp, we are prepared for the adventure that awaits in 2021 as we return to traditional summer camp. Our 2021 theme, “Knights of the Bushkill” will take us back to a nobler time when knights and dragons roamed the land.

## Program Highlights for 2021

- This summer at Resica Falls, we’re rethinking how we do campwide program. Wander around the Faire on Monday evening, participating in competitions like jousting, watching some performers, and snacking on your favorite medieval treats.
- Lunch Clubs, Action Areas, and the weekly Scavenger Hunt are all being reworked to meet the wants of our campers.
- Get your awesome costumes ready to take on exciting quests with the staff throughout the week!

## A Note on COVID-19
- As we begin to prepare for traditional summer camp in 2021 at Resica Falls, there are many new challenges that will undoubtedly present themselves to us. Know that at all times, the safety of our Scouts, leaders, and camp staff is our primary concern. We will do everything in our power to ensure that your stay at Resica in 2021 is not only filled with the adventure and the wonder of the outdoors, but is a safe experience for all.
