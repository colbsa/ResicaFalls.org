The summer of 2021 was a great way to put the OUTING back into Scouting at Resica Falls after our 2020 Virtual Camp. With a theme of “Knights of the Bushkill,” this summer took us back to a nobler time filled with wonder, mystery, knights, and dragons. New life was breathed into many of our traditional summer camp programs, including the Monday evening games, the Scavenger Hunt, and Lunch Clubs, and we were able to introduce our Quest Board to add new adventures to the week in camp. 

While COVID-19 might have caused some modifications to our typical summer operation, the fun, adventure, and lasting memories of a Resica Falls camping experience were stronger than ever!
