You have spoken and we're listening! For a variety of reasons, all expressed by our units, we've decided to extend our Early Bird registration to March 1st. Get in your unit deposit of $250 and a per Scout deposit of $50 to lock-in the early bird rate and to secure your place at Resica Falls in 2022. Don't delay and sign-up today at [ResicaFalls.org/summer/register](/summer/register)!
