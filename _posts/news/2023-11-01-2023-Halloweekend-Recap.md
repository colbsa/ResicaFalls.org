Resica Falls hosted our first Halloweekend on Saturday, October 28th. The program was open to the public and attended by just under 100 participants. The build-up to the event was featured on WNEP Channel 16 with a [video and story](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/monroe-county/halloweekend-fun-at-scout-camp-resica-falls-scout-reservation-halloweenn-spooky-scary-pumpkins/523-516e3ef0-4dd8-430d-965a-c0a969a27e4d?fbclid=IwAR2psAF05_KgF4g1ws2zaA8mMP538oaiXzqDQf0aRzPaTwLfma0LO2n91T8). 

The first program of its kind at Resica Falls, the night included a variety of exciting programs and opportunities, including:
 - Pumpkin painting, pumpkin bowling, face painting, and a costume contest in the Dining Hall.
 - A runaway hayride complete with witches, aliens, and hill people.
 - A Haunted Lodge that was inhabited by ghosts, werewolves, and a mad scientist!
 - Campfires with ghost stories, songs, and s’mores at the Campcraft Amphitheatre.

Scouts camping for the weekend, along with members of the local community, all enjoyed the variety of programs offered. One couple attending the event remarked “the price is right, the scare level is right - can’t wait to come back again next year!”

We can’t wait to grow this event next year with even more haunted fun! Keep a lookout at [resicafalls.org/halloween](resicafalls.org/halloween) for more details for Halloweekend 2024.
