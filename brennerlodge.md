Trooper Lodge stands in the former Great Bend portion of Resica Falls near the STEM Center, Archery Range, and COPE Course. The cabin has served many different functions over the last few years for both the summer and year-round operation. A rustic cabin, Trooper Lodge is in desperate need of repairs to continue to serve the Scouts and Scouters camping at Resica Falls all-year long. 

Resica Falls Scout Reservation and the Cradle of Liberty Council have launched the Brenner Project in order to renovate and rededicate Trooper Lodge in honor of Chris Brenner, who spent 15 summers at Resica Falls as Camp Director. The remodel will double the cabin capacity, add bathrooms and a kitchen with running water, and provide a look and design that unequivocally says, “Chris Brenner.” 

In addition to serving as a rentable cabin during the year-round operation, the new Brenner Lodge will serve as the Civics Center during summer camp. Currently operating under two canopies, the Civics Center plays host to such merit badges as Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Public Speaking, and Law. This remodel will provide this vital program area with the facilities it needs to promote good citizenship to our Scout campers at a superior level.
