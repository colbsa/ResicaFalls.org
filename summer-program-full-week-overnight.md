      Full-Week Overnight Camp at Musser is just that - a full week of camp! Starting Sunday afternoon and running through the campfire on Friday evening, this option gives your Cubs five nights and five days of program at camp. Meals are served family style as you camp in canvas wall tents on platforms as part of the pinnacle of the Musser camping experience. A hallmark of this experience in the Choose Your Own Adventure program. Come to camp as a family or as an entire pack. We recommend Full-Week Overnight Camp for older Cub Scouts - Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts (4th & 5th graders), but all Cubs and families are welcome!

      If a full-week of camp is too much adventure for your Scout, consider our <a href="/summer/day-camp">Day Camp</a> or <a href="/summer/weekend-overnight">Weekend Overnight Camp</a> programs for shorter stays at Musser Scout Reservation.
