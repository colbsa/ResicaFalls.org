Set aside the date, get your recipes ready, and plan to have lots of fun when you join us for the 3rd Annual Resica Falls Field Event Weekend on September 11-13, 2020. 

The Field Event Weekend allows your unit to take advantage of many of the great activities and facilities at Resica Falls Scout Reservation while honing your tent camping skills. Some of the events include orienteering, Dutch Oven cooking, fly fishing, climbing, and Cowboy Action Shooting. The Iron Chef Competition will utilize a “secret ingredient,” and Scouts will have 3.5 hours to complete their dish to be judged by a select panel of professional tasters.

Check back here as details are finalized.
