Situated in the beautiful Pocono Mountains, Resica Falls Scout Reservation is a 4,200-acre Scouting Paradise. Set in an endless track of mountain trails, clear streams, and waterfalls, Resica has an amazing program of activities for Scouts to enjoy during their summer camp experience and beyond. This paradise is home to hundreds of different trees, plants, and animals, and to over 3,000 Scouts each summer.

In 1957, the Valley Forge and Philadelphia Councils entered into a joint venture to develop this magnificent piece of land into a camp for Scouts to enjoy for generations to come. Although the Valley Forge Council would become the sole proprietor of the property in 1965, these same two councils would merge in 1996, creating the Cradle of Liberty Council. The Council would later enter into a land trust agreement, preserving the property forever as an undeveloped forest for Scouting use. In 2017, Resica Falls celebrated its 60th anniversary. 

The camp capacity is 600 participants each week in our Dining Hall operation. The Ranjo Clock Tower serves as a central meeting place outside the Dining Hall on the Parade Field. The camp boasts two shower house facilities that can accommodate both male and female campers and leaders. Our pool features a three-story water slide and Lake Roger – a 27-acre lake – is home to a trampoline and other aquatic park features, in addition to sailing, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and rowing. Since 2010, we have significantly upgraded the following program areas in camp: Rifle & Shotgun Ranges, Archery Range, Handicraft, STEM Center, Shop, ATV Course, Native American Village, and the COPE & Climbing Course. Since 2014, we have been upgrading our campsites with new tents, platforms, picnic tables, and carport canopies. The Richards Arena, our campfire amphitheater, seats 900 people and is state-of-the-art in lights and sound.

Today, Resica Falls remains committed to excellence in the areas of program development, facility improvement, and customer service. Tens of thousands of Scouts have enjoyed an experience among the hidden natural treasures, creating memories that will last a lifetime. Join us and see the adventure that awaits!
