      Making sure that Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts are prepared to join Scouts BSA troops is an important task of any pack and den. Webelos Woods is designed to help make sure each Cub is prepared to join a troop in the coming months. Confidence they have all the skills necessary when they cross the bridge is a key to any successful crossover.

      Webelos will experience a weekend of adventure, pitching their own tent and practicing Scout skills, as they make new friends while learning what Scouts BSA is all about. This piece of the Musser camping experience will have every body ready to take the next step in their Scouting adventure.
